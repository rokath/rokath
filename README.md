would you please be so kind to evaluate the option to write the DALIBU PC program in golang?
It is a new cool language and allows also to be linked with C-Code. You can find information about that for example in https://gitlab.com/teaage/gospace/blob/master/books/MasteringGo_CreateGolang_production_applications.pdf
I invited you to my so far private project https://gitlab.com/teaage/gospace/, where I put my learning results for now, but there is also plenty of information in the internet.

What could also be an option is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language), but I had no time so far to deal with it anyhow.

To loose not too much time in Sofia, I propose especially for Kamen:
Please install a Windows Subsystem for Linux debian image and additionally the gcc compiler inside debian using  the package manager apt-get
Please install Git bash
Please install https://www.gitkraken.com/
Please install https://code.visualstudio.com/
See https://gitlab.com/baumtec/meta/wikis/GitPcSetup for more details
Please install http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/
Please install https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html
Handy is also notepad++ especially for block editing
Please install TeraTerm
Probably you need also some MS DLL's but that we can solve directly.
