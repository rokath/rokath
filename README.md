## Embedded Programming is my passion

* [ ] Still sticking with C (liking function pointer arrays) in micro-controllers.

## My favorite PC language is [Go](https://go.dev)

### Why?

* Go is **open source**, sponsored, professionally developed and used by Google.
* Go is a **multi-purpose** language.
    * It supports graphics not directly but [GUI frameworks](https://blog.logrocket.com/best-gui-frameworks-go/) are around.
* Go is **object oriented**.
    * Go uses **composition** instead of inheritance - programs get cleaner this way.
* In Go **interfaces are implicit** - they need no explicit declaration.
    * This allows clean and simple APIs in your code without unneeded dependencies.
* Go is easy to learn, to use and gives quick programming success.
    * [x] [OSCON 2010: Rob Pike, "Public Static Void"](https://youtu.be/5kj5ApnhPAE)
    * [x] [dotGo 2015 - Rob Pike - Simplicity is Complicated](https://youtu.be/rFejpH_tAHM)
    * [ ] [Expressiveness of Go PDF](https://go.dev/talks/2010/ExpressivenessOfGo-2010.pdf)
* Go is a **compiled language**, therefore checks a lot before building the code.
    * You get most **errors at compile-time and not at run-time** as with scripting languages (like Python).
     The Go [compiler itself is fast](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DUm6U201o4w). It allows script like usage of Go as well.
    * The [Go program execution is fast](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Tf90fKykNDM).
        * Could be about half speed of a well written C program - not relevant for normal use cases. To get an equivalent "well written C programm" takes much longer than getting the Go program for a specific task.
* Go is a managed language making **memory leaks impossible**.
    * No explicit memory *allocation* and *free*.
* Go supports **slices**, a very light array management struct.
* Go has **pointers** but **no pointer arithmetic**, making code  more reliable this way.
* Go is designed to use **multi-core** machines and **single-core** ones and allows **easy multi-threading and inter-process communication**.
  * **Concurrent programming** using Go rotines and channels allow **efficient program structures**.
  * **Parallel execution** allows to use the full multicore power of modern systems easyly.
  * [x] [Concurrency is not Parallelism by Rob Pike ](https://youtu.be/oV9rvDllKEg)
* The **auto-formatting** as languge part is very comfortable.
    * This allows a bunch of helper tools.
* A **testing environment** comes with the language. Fuzzying is supported.
    * Simply create `my_test.go` files inside your Go package and run `go test ./...` in the project root.
* You get a **stand-alone runnable** without libraries dependencies.
    * No *missing library* anymore.
    * No *install ...* before running an executable.
* **Many platforms** are supprted, also **mobile** development.
* Go has an **integrated documentation** System.
    * Just add comments to your functions.
* **Easy Visibility control**: Packages export *UppercaseFunction* and hide *lowerCaseFunction*.
* Go can use **C/C++-code** and vice versa, but crossing the border takes time, so avoid that in loops.
    * [CGO](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo)
    * [SWIG](https://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/Go.html)
* **Compatibility**: Legacy Go code runs on new Go versions.
* Go has **generics** now.


## Disadvantages? 

* Not made for small microcontrollers.
    * BUT: There is [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/microcontrollers/).
* Not well suited for fast hard real-time applications on sub-millisecond level because of the stop-the-world garbage collector.
  * BUT: The GC gets better and better with new Go versions AND avoiding that Go uses the heap heavily, avoids GC at all.
