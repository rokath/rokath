## Embedded Programming is my passion

* [ ] Still sticking with C (liking function pointer arrays) 

## My favorite PC language is [Go](https://go.dev)

### Why?

* [ ] [OSCON 2010: Rob Pike, "Public Static Void"](https://youtu.be/5kj5ApnhPAE)
* [ ] [dotGo 2015 - Rob Pike - Simplicity is Complicated](https://youtu.be/rFejpH_tAHM)
* [ ] [Concurrency is not Parallelism by Rob Pike ](https://youtu.be/oV9rvDllKEg)
* [ ] [Expressiveness of Go PDF](https://go.dev/talks/2010/ExpressivenessOfGo-2010.pdf)
* Go is a **compiled language**, therefore **fast** and checks a lot before building the code.
* The Go compiler is incredible fast, allows script like usage of Go as well.
* Go is a managed language making **memory leaks impossible**.
* The **auto-formatting** as languge part is very comfortable.
* A **testing environment** comes with the language. Fuzzying is supported.
* You get a stand-alone runnable without libraries dependencies.
* Go is **open source**, sponsored and professionally developed and used by Google.
* **Many platforms** are supprted, also **mobile** development.
* Go has an **integrated documentation** System.
* Go can use **C-code** and vice versa.
* **Compatibility**: Legacy Go code runs on new Go versions.
* Go has **generics** now.

## Disadvantages? 

* Not made for small microcontrollers.
* Not well suited for fast hard real-time applications on millisecond level because of the stop-the-world garbage collector.
